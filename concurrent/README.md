Purpose of this repository:
1. Learn concurrency Go style for Java developers:
	1. Helping Java developers get trained in the Go programming language from a point of view of Java concurrency.
	2. Help Java developers migrate from Java's Thread/Future based concurrency to Go's Goroutine/Channel based concurrency.
	3. Reproduce common concurrency patterns used in Java through Go's model of concurrency.

Layout of samples (source code contains documentation to introduce ideas/concepts)

1. ch1 - Demonstrates forking and joining of goroutines. (https://github.com/rvauradkar1/goutil/blob/master/concurrent/ch1/forkjoin/main.go)
2. ch2 - Futures demo (while there are no futures in Go, helps to bridge from Java to Go)
   1. future - Simple channel demo to communicate data across 2 goroutines. (https://github.com/rvauradkar1/goutil/blob/master/concurrent/ch2/future/main.go)
   2. future2 - A "streaming" channel. This is when a channel communicates more than one value.(https://github.com/rvauradkar1/goutil/blob/master/concurrent/ch2/future2/main.go) 
   3. future3 - A pipeline - chaining of channels. (https://github.com/rvauradkar1/goutil/blob/master/concurrent/ch2/future3/main.go)
3. ch3 - Demonstarted geberator/streaming pattern.
   1. basic - A simple generator. (https://github.com/rvauradkar1/goutil/blob/master/concurrent/ch3/generator/basic/main.go)
   2. advanced1 - The consumer chooses when to stop the generator with a "done" channel. (https://github.com/rvauradkar1/goutil/blob/master/concurrent/ch3/generator/advanced1/main.go)
   3. advanced2 - The producer chooses when to stop the generator based on some condition. (https://github.com/rvauradkar1/goutil/blob/master/concurrent/ch3/generator/advanced2/main.go)
4. ch4 - fanin - Demonstrates the fanin pattern - multiple tasks are generated by multiple sources and "fannedin" to one goroutine for processing.
   1. basic - A single task generator produces multiple tasks. (https://github.com/rvauradkar1/goutil/blob/master/concurrent/ch4/fanin/basic/main.go)
   2. advanced - Multiple task generators produde multiple tasks. (https://github.com/rvauradkar1/goutil/blob/master/concurrent/ch4/fanin/advanced/main.go)
5. ch5 - fanout - Demonstrates the fanout process - Tasks are generated by a single goroutine and "fanned" out to multiple goroutines. Also demonstrates uses of sync.Mutex and sync.Waitgroup. (https://github.com/rvauradkar1/goutil/blob/master/concurrent/ch5/fanout/main.go)


6. Learn Web development
	1. Basic setup of a Http/Https Webserver.
	2. Folder structures for Web apps.
	3. Demonstrate proxy/reverse-proxy capabilities.

As more capabilties are added, this page will be updated.
